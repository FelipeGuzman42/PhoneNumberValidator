# TestAssignment

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Frontend Developer Task
For this task, you have to write a simple phone number validator based on requirements. There is 
already an API for you- all you have to do is write a client for it. 

## Implementation 
1. Create a working client based on Angular 10+, which is able to post form with specified 
payload (see below) to the provided API URL. 
2. Main focus is on error handling: 
Both frontend validation and backend errors should be handled and displayed. 
It should be clear for the user which input field produced an error. 
4. We require tests. Itâ€™s up to you the style and how exhaustive they are. 
5. Define your own view of the data and be ready to talk about why you chose this layout. Create 
a user friendly interface, preferably with Angular material but any other component library is 
welcome . There are no requirements here. Use your creativity and your knowledge in UI/UX.
